The company quoted that the bike would give the mileage around 80 kms per charge but it gives 20kms which is useless. Within this 3 months I have complained to the service center number of times and they agreed it is fault of battery which they would replace. Until now the battery hasn't been replaced even after multiple visits. I have got stuck so many times on the way and beg the near by shops to provide me the socket for charging. It is so embarrassing for me to do that. I have thrown this vehicle to the outlet from were i purchased it expecting that they will not fix the problem. I suggest you to please think twice before you purchase this vehicle. The service is not good. "
